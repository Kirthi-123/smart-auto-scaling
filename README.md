AI-based application performance monitoring and scaling system
Absolutely! Here's a clean, professional, and attractive `README.md` for your **Smart Auto-Scaling System** project.

# 🔁 Smart Auto-Scaling System

An intelligent system that monitors real-time CPU usage, predicts future load using machine learning (Polynomial Regression), and proactively makes scaling decisions based on forecasted demand patterns.

---

## 🚀 Features

✅ Real-time CPU usage monitoring using `psutil`  
✅ Predicts future CPU demand using Polynomial Regression (`scikit-learn`)  
✅ Auto-scaling logic that decides when to scale up or down  
✅ Simulates scaling by launching/stopping worker processes  
✅ Visualizes actual vs. predicted CPU usage using `matplotlib`

---

## 📂 Project Structure

```

├── main.py          # Orchestrates monitoring → prediction → scaling
├── monitor.py       # Monitors and logs current CPU usage
├── predictor.py     # Predicts future CPU load using regression
├── scaler.py        # Makes scaling decisions based on predicted data
├── worker.py        # Simulates an extra worker node/process

## 💻 How to Run

### 1️⃣ Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

### 2️⃣ Start the Auto-Scaling System

```bash
python main.py
```

This runs:

* `monitor.py` → collects CPU data
* `predictor.py` → generates CPU usage forecast
* `scaler.py` → makes a decision to scale up/down

If scaling up, `worker.py` is launched to simulate handling the increased load.

---

## 📊 Output Example

```
Starting CPU monitoring...
CPU Usage: 22.5%
...
✅ CPU data saved to cpu_data.csv
📈 CPU Prediction Plot displayed
📊 Predicted Average CPU: 81.42%
⚠️  Predicted High Load - SCALE UP
🚀 Scaling up... Launching extra worker
```

---

## 📈 Visualization

The system generates a graph comparing:

* Historical CPU usage
* Forecasted CPU usage for the next 10 seconds

This helps visualize system performance and scaling decisions.

---

## 🛠️ Customization

* **Change scaling thresholds** in `scaler.py`:

```python
scale_up_threshold = 75
scale_down_threshold = 30
```

* **Adjust CPU sampling time** in `monitor.py`:

```python
for _ in range(60):  # Monitor for 60 seconds
```

---

## 📌 Requirements

Install all dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Contents of `requirements.txt`:

```
psutil
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
scikit-learn
```

---

## 🧠 Future Improvements

* Replace polynomial regression with LSTM or ARIMA for better accuracy
* Add monitoring for memory and disk I/O
* Hook into Docker/Kubernetes for real scaling
* Add web dashboard (e.g., Flask + Chart.js)
* Trigger alerts via email/Slack
